 ## 💭 Once Again, You Write "I Need to Change" in Your Notes 
 
 Then close your phone. 
 
 You know you want to change.  
 But you don't know where to start.  
 You've written goals countless times, but never really made them happen. 
 
 **It's not that you're not trying hard enough.**  
 **It's just that walking alone is really hard.** 
 
 Almond is that friend who's willing to walk with you.  
 It won't push you. It won't judge you.  
 It's just there, quietly, giving you a gentle nudge when you need it.

 ## 🧠 Why "Almond"? 
 
 Deep inside your brain, there's a region called the amygdala.  
 It governs your emotions, memories, and that primal sense of safety. 
 
 **Almond is that little guardian living inside you.** 
 
 It remembers every moment of hesitation and every act of courage.  
 It sees your vulnerability and believes in your strength.  
 It won't let you face those "I don't know where to start" moments alone.

 ## 🌍 What Are We Going Through? 
 
 **In the Internet Era**, information became abundant.  
 **In the AI Era**, intelligence is now at our fingertips. 
 
 But what's truly scarce was never information or intelligence.  
 It's: 
 - How to make better decisions 
 - How to truly understand yourself 
 - How to keep growing, not just with bursts of motivation 
 
 **Almond believes:**  
 The future belongs to those who know how to think, decide, and understand themselves.

 ## ✨ What Can Almond Do for You? 
 
 ### 🧠 Help You Build Your Own Memory System 
 
 Most people don't have bad memory—they just **don't know how to remember**. 
 
 Almond helps you: 
 - Transform what you want to remember into **sound, images, and associations**—3D memory 
 - Gradually form **your own memory anchors** based on what you record 
 - Not just a memo app, but making important things **truly stick in your mind** 
 
 **For example:**  
 You want to remember "be gentler with yourself."  
 Almond helps you visualize: a warm cup of tea, a hug, the words "you're already doing great."  
 Next time you're exhausted, these images will naturally surface, reminding you to be kind to yourself.

 **End of the year—how was 2025?**  
 Almond reflects with you: 
 - What did you accomplish this year?

 - In what moments did you feel most authentic? 
 
 **New year—what do you want for 2026?**  
 Almond helps you: 
 - Break down goals into actionable steps 
 - Find a rhythm and approach that works for you 
 - Not pie-in-the-sky dreams, but a path you can actually walk

 ### 🧭 Help You Think More Clearly 
 
 **Should I change jobs? End this relationship? Try that idea?** 
 
 Almond won't give you direct answers.  
 But it will use different mental models to help you think it through: 
 - **First Principles Thinking**: What really matters here? 
 - **Inversion**: When would this be a bad decision? 
 - **Second-Order Thinking**: If I do this, what happens next? 
 
 Once you've thought it through, you'll know what to do.
